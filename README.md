# Drite APIs

This repository contains the original interface definitions of public
Drite APIs that support both REST and gRPC protocols. Reading the
original interface definitions can provide a better understanding of
Drite APIs and help you to utilize them more efficiently. You can also
use these definitions with open source tools to generate client
libraries, documentation, and other artifacts.
